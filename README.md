# CV-APP

This project is a web application which helps generate a CV based on details inputted by the user

## Highlight

This project utilizes JSPDF as well as HTML2CSS to allow users to download their resume's

## My personal Takeways
This was my first project built using React, Learning how to use functional components and handling states for the first time and gaining familarity with using react. 
I also styled the entire project using TailwindCSS for the first time which was a fun experience.
